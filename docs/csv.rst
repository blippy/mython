CSV to HDF5
-----------

Problem
~~~~~~~

You want to take columns from a CSV file and store them in an HDF5 file

Solution
~~~~~~~~

Use the ``csvh5`` script.

.. warning:: The script is hard-coded to work on a very specific data sample. It needs work to make it usable as a general tool. Still, it's a start


Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~

The script is a mython bash script that calls the module ``csvh5.py``.
